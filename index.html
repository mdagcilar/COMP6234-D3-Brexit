  	<h1>What's Really The Effect Of Brexit?</h1>
  	<h2>COMP6234 - January 11, 2017 </h2>

	<!-- Introduction -->
  	<div id="intro">
	  	Below are articles published by different news outlets describing how Brexit has had a direct negative impact on these wide range of economic issues. The value of the pound has dropped significantly by about 18% to a 30-year low since the referendum result. However, have these economic issues such as retail sales and house prices been negatively affected and so soon after the result? Scroll down to see how data collected from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) contradicts these articles by displaying real data.

				Retail sales estimates are an important short-term indicator of consumer confidence and strength of consumer spending. 
				Other factors also influence retail sales such as prices, weather, and the overall financial position of households. 
				<!--In August, the volume of retail sales decreased by 0.2% compared with July 2016. -->
				In 2016, growth was 1.6% for the following months (June, July and August) compared to the previous 3 months, and 5.5% higher than a year earlier. The line chart below supports annual growth in retail sales volumes continued to strengthen in November 2016, extending the positive trend seen since mid-2013.
				By this observation of the graph it can be witness that Brexit has not had any immediate impact towards the volume of retail sales.
			</p>
			<script src=js/retailSales.js type="text/javascript"></script>
			<p>
				As stated in one of the articles above written by the Wall Street Journal - "U.K. retail sales declined in August after increasing in July, according to a survey by a trade group, adding to a mixed picture of consumer spending in the wake of Britain's decision to leave the EU."
				<br>
				<br>
				This statement, although true is not a direct result of Brexit. Looking back until 2011, the data in the graph clearly shows a year upon year decline trend in retail sales in the month of August every year. Followed by a large increase in sales leading up to the Christmas holidays in September, October and November forming a cycle.
				
				This particular source has looked at a very small subset of data and reported a drop in retail sales as their opening statement in a news article to scare and misguide the public. Only the months July and August were analysed and therefore, created a statement which purposely tells a partial story.

				Retail sales remain strong and within trend predictions following the result of the referendum, therefore, having no effect at this current point in time.
				<!--In the coming months or after the leave date in March there will possibly be a decline in volume, however, until the leave date the trend is expected to remain positive.-->

				Average house prices in the UK have increased by 8.3% in the year to July 2016 (down from 9.7% in the year to June 2016), continuing the strong growth seen since the end of 2013.

		    	The UK treasury predicted a heavy "shock" to the housing and property industry in the wake of Brexit but months down the line from the announcement. This may be true in the longer term of Brexit, but in the short term there does not seem to have beena major change in the housing prices. It is said that the housing market has held up so far due to the broader economy performing better than expected.

			In conclusion, after analysing these areas with data published from the Office of National Statistics, our study showed Brexit has yet to take a real national effect over the economical issues covered. Apart from the clear drop in value of sterling, the UK economy has remained stable throughout the inital shock of the vote.
			<br><br>
			The true aftermath is yet to unfold and potentially will do in the following months to come, especially in March 2017 once article 50 is officially triggered and subsequently in 2019 when the UK divides from the European Union.
